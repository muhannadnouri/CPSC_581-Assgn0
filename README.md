# Functionality
Welcome to the Trump Button, Project 0 in CPSC 581 W19. This project was created by Alexander Lam, Joseph Gorospe, Michael Verwaayen, Mitchell Rudy, and Muhannad Nouri. A combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, along with original photo and audio elements, create the button itself. The code and animation elements were all hand done, without the use of external libraries.

Interactions with the button itself can be classified into three different categories. Non-interaction with the button, defined by no action by the user for a specified time period, cause an alternate version of Trump to appear due to lack of attention. To counteract this and revert to normal trump, simply move the cursor over to him. You might even get a smile out of it!

Left Clicking on Trump himself angers the president, causing him to send out miniature tweets and slowly become angrier, shown by a gradual red tinge that builds upon successive clicks, and slowly fades with a lack of interaction. Right clicking on him reverts trump to a more defensive posture, slowly building a wall of bricks between him and the user.
